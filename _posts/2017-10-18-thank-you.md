# THANK YOU ALL

As all good things organizing and attending EuRuKo2017 had come to an end. We really enjoyed organizing this amazing event,
the fun and the less fun parts both (maybe the less fun parts a little bit less :) )

Now that EuRuKo 2017 is few weeks behind us and everyone had the chance to get back to their normal ways,
the time to say goodbye has come. This is the final blog post from the team behind the 2017 edition of EuRuKo.
