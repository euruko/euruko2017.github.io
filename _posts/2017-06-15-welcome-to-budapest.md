# WELCOME TO BUDAPEST!

We have a series of posts coming up to help you get the best out of your trip to Budapest for this year’s conference. This first post is designed to help you with the logistics of travelling to Hungary, getting around and finding the right accommodation for your stay.

We hope you’re excited to visit - especially if it’s your first time to Hungary. It’s a great time to enjoy the city (and the conference, of course!) because in late September Budapest retains the charm of late summer, with pleasant temperatures and all the beauty and culture you’d expect from a vibrant and historic location.

## Arriving and settling in
As with any travel, it’s worth taking a few minutes to read up on what you can expect when you arrive in Hungary. We really like this [great website](http://visitinghungary.com/info) which tells you about the airport, getting through customs, our currency, travel into and around the city and much more.

## Where to stay
There are many hotels around the venue to suit a range of budgets so you’re sure to find one to suit your requirements. We recommend that you book one in Midtown Budapest, preferably, in a walking distance of the conference. As usual, hotel rooms are best booked sooner rather than later to guarantee you the best room for the best price.

### The ones closest to the venue are:

 * [CityPark Apartment ](http://www.cityparkapartment.com)
 * [Thermal Apartment Budapest** ](http://thermal-appartment-budapest.go-budapest-hotels.com/)
 * [Terrace Apartments at City Park ](https://www.booking.com/hotel/hu/terrace-apartment-at-city-park.hu.html)
 * [Garay Terrace Residence*** ](http://garayterrace.com/)
 * [Galeria Apartments ](http://galeria-apartments.go-budapest-hotels.com/en/)

 * [Ibis Budapest Heroes Square *** ](http://www.accorhotels.com/gb/hotel-6564-ibis-budapest-heroes-square/index.shtml)

### And, of course, Airbnb is always an option.

Be sure to book early in order to get the closest and cheapest listings. If you don’t find anything suitable around the venue, check out the listings around underground stations, such as
[Nyugati Pályaudvar](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest-Nyugati+Railway+Terminal/),
[Oktogon](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest,+Oktogon/),
[Deák Ferenc Square](https://www.google.hu/maps/place/Budapest,+Deák+Ferenc+tér/).
