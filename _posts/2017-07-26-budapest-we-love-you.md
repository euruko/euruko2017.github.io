# BUDAPEST, WE LOVE YOU – OUR RECOMMENDATIONS TO DISCOVER THE CITY

It’s a real honour to be hosting the EuRuKo Conference here in Budapest.
It’s no secret that we love this city (I guess we’re a bit biased!)
but we’re pretty sure you’re going to love it too.

So that you can get the most out of your trip to Budapest,
we’ve pulled together our favourite things to do in and around the city, here goes:


## Crossing the Danube on foot

![Crossing the Danube on foot](/assets/crossing-danube.jpg "Crossing the Danube on foot")

If there’s one thing you simply have to do during your time here,
it’s walk across one of the many iconic Danube bridges.
Choose one of the central bridges if you can and if possible
go at dusk or on a crisp morning at dawn. No matter which crossing you choose,
you’ll enjoy an awesome view over the Danube river, the
[Gellért Hill](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/gellert-hill-2/), the
[Hungarian Parliament](https://welovebudapest.com/en/2014/08/07/house-of-style-new-lights-on-the-hungarian-parliament/)
building, the buildings along both banksof the Danube and of course
[Buda Castle](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/buda-castle-2/).
It’s no surprise this whole area is
[UNESCO World Heritage Listed](http://welovebudapest.com/en/2014/12/04/budapests-sites-on-the-unesco-world-heritage-list/).

If walking isn’t really your thing, don’t worry.
You can use the tram to cross the river on either
Petőfi Bridge or Margaret Bridge so you can sit back
and enjoy the remarkable view of the city.

## Bathing at Széchenyi Bath

![Bathing at Széchenyi Bath](/assets/szechenyi-bath.jpg "Bathing at Széchenyi Bath")

[Széchenyi Bath](http://www.szechenyibath.hu/) is beautiful any time of year,
but when the summer is over it is a much more unique experience to bath outside.
This is the biggest bath in Budapest and also it is very close to the EuRuKo conference location.

## A bottle of wine by the Danube

![A bottle of wine by the Danube](/assets/danube-wine.jpg "A bottle of wine by the Danube")

Most people in **Budapest** have a memory of enjoying a bottle of wine
with friends or a date along the **Danube**. Whether sitting on **Liberty Bridge**,
on one of the piers, or at a riverside bar like [Raqpart](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/raqpart-2/)
this is something not to miss when you’re in **Budapest**.

## Eating lángos at Roman Riverbank

![Eating lángos at Roman Riverbank](/assets/langos.jpg "Eating lángos at Roman Riverbank")

If you’d like to get a taste of a riverbank holiday then **Római Part**
(Roman Riverbank in English) is the spot for you.
It's the site of those, who'd spend all their days on the riverbank,
eating **fried fish** or **lángos** (you will love lángos :) )
with a good cold pint of beer in the sunshine.
It would be difficult to say how many shops and stands line the entire row of **eateries,
lángos buffets** and **hamburger joints** that compete for the bellies of visitors here.

You shouldn't miss it, especially in good weather. You can even get there by
[boat](http://www.bkk.hu/apps/menetrend/pdf/8120/20170715/b.pdf).

## The city's night lights

![The city's night lights](/assets/city-night-light.jpg "The city's night lights")

Budapest is arguably one of the prettiest cities in the whole world,
and this seems even more true at night when the city lights
illuminate the inner-city stretch of the Danube. Budapest really comes alive at night -
the lights of [Chain Bridge](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/chain-bridge-2/),
Buda Castle, Parliament building and the  Liberty Statue atop Gellért Hill
all illuminate to make our city quite magical after dark.

## Ruin pubs and never-ending parties

![Ruin pubs and never-ending parties](/assets/ruin-pubs.jpg "Ruin pubs and never-ending parties")

So, you’ve heard Budapest is the place to party?
We can promise you it’s going to be every inch
the party you’re hoping for. No, wait. It’s going to be even better!

When it comes to nightlife, you can find something for everyone.
From traditional Hungarian dances to crazy night clubs.
Then, you’ll get caught up in something that wasn’t planned AT ALL.
Just roll with it, you’re in Budapest!

We should probably mention the well-known [ruin pubs](http://ruinpubs.com/) too.
Ruin bars are all the rage in Budapest and have been around for 10 years since
the founding of [Szimpla Kert](http://ruinpubs.com/index.php?id=romkocsmak_adatlap&kocsma=7),
the mecca of all ruin bars.

These bars are built in Budapest’s old District VII neighbourhood
(the old Jewish quarter) in the ruins of abandoned buildings, stores, or lots.
You sure can have a taste of Budapest at these bars.

Finally, you are going to meet great people from all over the world, with
some of them you will just share a drink and the famous “egészségedre”
(“Cheers!” in Hungarian), and others will become your friends for life.

## Climbing Gellért Hill, visiting Castle district and the Parliament

![Climbing Gellért Hill, visiting Castle district and the Parliament](/assets/gellert-hill.jpg "Climbing Gellért Hill, visiting Castle district and the Parliament")

This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning the three most iconic places in Budapest.
If you can extend your stay past the conference itself,
then we definitely recommend a visit to any (or all) of them:

**Gellért Hill** is a short hike away but the reward at the top is well worth the effort –
the view over the city is incredible.

**Buda Castle** might be the city’s crowning jewel but the district around it also worth a long walk.
With its historical buildings, you’ll feel like you’re in a different era.
It is also worth to visit at dusk as the warm lights make the area magical.

The 100-year-old **Parliament** of Hungary building
is the world's third largest Parliament building.
Guided tours of the Parliament are available when the National Assembly is not in session.
The tour takes about 45 minutes, and is well worth the price,
as it covers the main entrance stairs and hall, one of the lobbies,
the old House of Lords and the Hungarian Crown Jewels.

## Inner-city picnics

![Inner-city picnics](/assets/inner-city-picnics.jpg "Inner-city picnics")

On a nice Sunday afternoon (after a long exhausting weekend) there is nothing better
than a picnic in one of the city’s parks like
[Károlyi Garden](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/karolyi-kert-karolyi-garden-2/),
[City Park](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/varosliget-2/) or
[Margaret Island](https://welovebudapest.com/en/venue/margaret-island-2/)
with some snacks, a bottle of wine and some friends. The sound of laughter and chatter,
bicycles strewn on the grass and dogs playing - this is one of the best ways
to chill out in Budapest. Warm afternoons seem like they will never end
and that feeling of summertime freedom - in one of the world’s most cosmopolitan cities -
is simply the best.
