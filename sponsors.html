            Catawiki’s mission is to make special items available to everyone.
            Our online auction website attracts 14 million monthly users
            from around the globe to participate in weekly auctions across
            a variety of categories for special objects.
            The items we have auctioned off include a lock of Napoleon’s hair,
            a mammoth skeleton and the most expensive set of Lego ever produced!
            The Catawiki office are located in Amsterdam and Assen in The Netherlands.
            We are very proud to be the first Benelux company to have received
            an investment from the famous Accel Partners (first venture
            capital investors in Facebook, as well as Dropbox, Spotify, and Etsy).
